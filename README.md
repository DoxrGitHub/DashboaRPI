# DashboaRPI

I made this because I couldn't find a satisfactory equivalent.

## Dependencies

- Node.js + NPM
- Python installed

NPM Dependencies:

- convert-seconds
- express
- node-pty
- socket.io

## Features

- Uptime
- Memory Usage
- CPU Usage Percentage
- Some Networking Info
- CPU temperature
- Web Shell*
- Password Based Authorization

*Web shell *should* work but a lot of extra features are broken, and I have no interest in fixing them. Also, it's minified, sorry.

## Configuration

Edit the `drpi.conf` file.

Config Options:

- Port
- Password
